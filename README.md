- ‚ö° Multi-threaded processing
- üß™ Test file generation for demo purposes

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- Windows OS (for thumbnail functionality)

### Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install requests pillow beautifulsoup4 cinemagoer urllib3
```

Or install all dependencies using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Some packages like `tkinter` and `ctypes` come with Python's standard library.

You should also create a requirements.txt file containing:
```
requests
pillow
beautifulsoup4
cinemagoer
urllib3
```

## Known Issues

- Thumbnail functionality is Windows-specific
- Some movie titles may not be correctly parsed from filenames
- FFmpeg path must be set manually on first run
- Movie title matching depends on filename accuracy
- Large files may take longer to process
- Some IMDb metadata might be incomplete

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Cross-platform thumbnail support
- [ ] Batch processing optimization
- [ ] Additional metadata sources
- [ ] Custom naming templates
- [ ] Video format conversion options
